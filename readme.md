# YouTube Ads Auto Skipper
Simple chrome extension to watch for ads, and automatically seek and skip them.
This is not ad blocking as per say, since technically the ad is loaded and shown first, however the logic inside this extension seeks the ad to the end and then presse the skip ad button instantly. This all ideally happens under <50 ms thus creating a seamless experience.
